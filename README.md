# vertexAI_Hackathon_2024

Submitted by: **Piyaporn Puangprasert**

This web app: **Chatbot Google Texes Expert**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Inspiration
In my quest to acquire new skills and enhance my knowledge, I embarked on a journey to build a chatbot using the powerful **VertexAI** platform of Google Cloud. This endeavor involved utilizing two key components:

**Agent Builder: **Agent Builder is a user-friendly tool within VertexAI that simplifies the process of creating and managing chatbots. It provides a visual interface that allows me to design conversational flows, train the bot using machine learning, and integrate it with other systems.
**Google Cloud Storage: **Google Cloud Storage serves as a reliable and scalable storage solution for my chatbot's training data and other resources. The integration with VertexAI enables seamless access to the necessary data during the training and deployment processes.


## What it does

This chatbot will answer users about taxes The Google form k-10 form.

## How we built it

In my workflow, I leverage the power of Google Cloud's VertexAI platform to build and deploy machine learning models. With VertexAI, I can easily access pre-built components and tools, allowing me to focus on the core aspects of my models.

For building this app, the front end of my applications, I utilize Vite, a lightning-fast development environment. Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) capability enables efficient and rapid development, significantly reducing iteration times.

To manage and store my application's assets, I rely on Google Cloud Storage. This robust and scalable object storage service provides reliable and cost-effective storage for my frontend code, images, and other static assets.

If I had more time, I would further enhance my workflow by incorporating additional features and functionalities. This may include implementing user authentication and authorization, adding database support, or integrating with third-party services.

Overall, my workflow combines the strengths of VertexAI, Vite, Google Cloud Storage, and APIs to create a robust and efficient development environment for my web applications.

## Challenges we ran into
My first time building it. It was a challenge to learn everything from tutorials and YouTube

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I can see the chatbot give me the answer back about the information that I donâ€™t need to read from PDF by myself
Absolutely! Chatbots are incredibly useful tools designed to provide quick and efficient information retrieval. Instead of spending time reading through lengthy PDF documents, you can simply ask the chatbot a specific question, and it will generate a concise and relevant answer. This not only saves you time but also allows you to focus on the most important aspects of your work.


## What we learned
I have learned how easy to create an app with Google Vertex AI 

## What's next for Google Taxes Expert
To integrate my application's frontend with the backend services, I plan to utilize RESTful APIs. APIs allow for seamless communication between different components of my application, enabling the exchange of data and functionality.
